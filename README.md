## Introduction
This resource provides implementation for Prescribed performance sliding mode controller in controlling atonomous vehicles in double lane changing maneuver, as presented in our paper ["Prescribed Tracking Performace for Lateral Control of an Autonomous Vehicle with High-Gain Observer"](10.1109/ICCAIS56082.2022.9990307).
The simulation is carried out using MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim 2017.
